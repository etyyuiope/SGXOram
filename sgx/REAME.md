# Some Guidances For Writing SGX Applications

* Enclave functions should be declared in `./include/enclave/*.hh`.
* Unstrusted functions should be declared in `./include/app/*.hh`.
* Wrapper functions such as `ecall_xxx()`, `ocall_xxx()` should also be defined in `./include/app/*.hh`.
* The trusted interfaces declared in `enclave.edl` should be implemented in file `./src/enclave/*.cc`, and the untrusted interfaces should be implemented in file `./src/app/*.cc`.
* The proxy functions are auto-generated by `sgx_edger8r`, do not modify them.
