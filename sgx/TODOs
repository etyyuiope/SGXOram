1. Add the timer for calculating the cost of access / evict.
  * But how do we use chrono in the enclave? RDTSC will not give the correct time;
  * Using OCall will cause delay which may give inaccurate time...
  
2. Calculate the cloud storage for the ORAM tree. OK
3. Should do experiments across different block size?...
4. Or fixing some invariants?..

Partition ORAM settings:
* We fix the bucket size of the underlying Path ORAM to be 4 with different block size from 512 Bytes to 4096 Bytes 512, 1024, 2048, 4096.
* We initialize the Partition ORAM with half real block and dummy block such that the total number of the blocks fits the ORAM Tree.

SO2 settings:
* We initialize the SO2 ORAM with half real block and dummy block such that the total number of the blocks fits the ORAM Tree and level of the whole tree 
  <=4 forever. The parameters are fine-tuned.
* Do experiments of comparison between cache-enabled and cache-disabled.
* Position Map is small and can be stored on the server side (enclave EPC size is enough).

---- New TODO: 2022.6.7 ----
1. We need to modify the eviction procedure -> reverse-lexicongraphically eviction.
2. There are still bugs ? in the code.
3. (Maybe) we need to implement the code of DPathOram.

Multiple bugs:
* Since there could be dummy blocks that are selected as the target of eviction / write, we cannot modify the position map accidentally.
